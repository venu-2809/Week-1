Waste Classification Using CNN

This repository contains the work completed during the first week of my internship, focusing on classifying waste using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal of this project is to build a model that can categorize waste into appropriate classes to facilitate efficient waste management and recycling.

Project Overview

The project implements a CNN-based approach to classify images of waste. The classification process aids in identifying whether the waste is organic, recyclable, or any other category, promoting effective waste disposal practices.

Features

Preprocessing of the dataset.

Training a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras.

Evaluation of the model's performance.

Visualization of training and validation results.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle:
